Vito is creating software that uses vitals to detect infection in realtime. Recent studies have shown how infectious diseases which include but are not limited to, Covid-19 and the common flu, are detectable through changes in data that are being tracked through common smartwatches today. As this research gains more and more backing from higher institutions of health and science, it's time to create an application that can be used to help to create a safer environment for all.

### Vito has one goal...

1. Using data and analytical methods to come up with conclusive alerts that can warn you about possible illness.

### What devices is Vito compatible with?
* Android 
* IOS

### Questions about security
Vito is an application that runs all computations completely on your mobile device. With this, we ensure that your data stays your data and isn't being sent to a server to be manipulated or observed. Vito highly emphasises confidentiality so we built an application that uses data that is available already from your smarthwatch, such as heart rate and oxidation levels, and just runs it through models to see if there are any abnormalities.


### Vito exclusives:
1. Stress Event Alerts - Stress alerts that may be due to infection and allow you, the user, to take what actions you deem appropriate
2. Background Processing - Open the app once, give us health and notification permissions, then the app works in the background constantly and will send a notification      if there is a change in physiological markers



### Why Vito?
Vito is striving to make a difference in the day-to-day world to ensure an added level of safety to all across the globe. Vito has been proven to catch illnesses through usage a day or two before symptoms occur. We at Vito believe that if we can try to get a new, innovative, and easily accessible way to track our own health, we can take steps to insure safrey to those who are more at risk.
